description: middleware enabled static site generator that builds in the browser (or node.js), powered by desirae.js.

Desi, the DIY Blog Platform for Muggles (and Wizards)

Desi is a middleware enabled static site generator that takes static site generation where it has never been before:
to the browser.

Although it also works in node.js, the intent of Desi is to be a pure-javascript static content management system
that can be used on any platform with a simple interface that normal people can use.

desirae.js, the core library, is much like express. It has almost no features on it's own and relies on middleware
to drive the workflow and perform the site generation.
