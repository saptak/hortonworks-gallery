Ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts wiki pages into HTML pages suitable for publishing on a website. Ikiwiki stores pages and history in a revision control system such as Subversion or Git. There are many other features, including support for blogging and podcasting, as well as a large array of plugins.

Alternatively, think of ikiwiki as a particularly flexible static site generator with some dynamic features.
