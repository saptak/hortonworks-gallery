### Why is BoaGen better than the others?

It's so simple to use and also the best part ever is that BoaGen is a simple Bash script as compared to other static page/site generators which require the installation of Ruby, Python and Ruby Gems. Think about it, what system doesn't have Bash? Best of all it's Free Software!

### When to use Boagen?

You should use BoaGen if you are the type of person that needs a no frills basic HTML page to be generated and do not want to install anything else on your machine.
